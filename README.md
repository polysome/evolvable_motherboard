evolvable_motherboard
=====================

This project has three parts

1. A gerber format design of the evolveable motherboard. This is a experimental PCB created by Paul Layzell for his 2001 thesis Hardware Evolution: On the Nature of Artificially Evolved Electronic Circuits.

2. A USB FPGA based interface board to the evolveable motherboard replacing the IO board, ADC and configuration board.

3. Example and diagnostic code, and perhaps a management GUI.

The hardware is released under the CERN OHL and the software is GPLv3.
