The Evolvable Motherboard
=========================

This is an experimental PCB created by Paul Layzell for his 2001 thesis [Hardware Evolution: On the Nature of
Artificially Evolved Electronic Circuits](https://github.com/polysome/evolvable_motherboard/blob/master/documentation/Hardware%20Evolution:%20On%20the%20Nature%20of%20Artificially%20Evolved%20Electronic%20Circuits%20%282001%29.pdf). 

A single FPGA based interconnect now replaces the digital IO card, the custom ISA configuration card and the ADC board. Example and diagnostic code is included and a GUI is planned.

The hardware is released under the CERN OHL v1.2 and the software is GPL v3.
