evolvable_motherboard
=====================

This is an experimental PCB created by Paul Layzell for his 2001 thesis Hardware Evolution: On the Nature of
Artificially Evolved Electronic Circuits. A single FPGA based USB interface board now replaces the digital IO card,
the ADC card and the custom ISA configuration card. Example and diagnostic code is included and a GUI is planned.

The hardware is released under the CERN OHL v1.2 and the software is GPL v3.
