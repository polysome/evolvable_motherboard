The Evolvable Motherboard
=========================

This is an experimental PCB created by Paul Layzell for his 2001 thesis Hardware Evolution: On the Nature of
Artificially Evolved Electronic Circuits. 

A single FPGA based interconnect now replaces the digital IO card, the custom ISA configuration card and the ADC board. Example and diagnostic code is included and a GUI is planned.

The hardware is released under the CERN OHL v1.2 and the software is GPL v3.
